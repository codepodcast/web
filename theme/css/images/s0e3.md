## Concurrency – Event loops and Сoroutines

When one thinks about concurrency he can imagine a queue in front of a bar staying and asking every second if pass is open. But what if everyone in the queue could do his own business and security guy would come for each asking to come in? 
Continuing talk about concurrency we can not miss such concepts as event loops and coroutines. Modern web could not be possible without them. Callbacks are what makes it possible to serve thousands of clients with just one thread.
